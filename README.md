*Interlink Async framework*

**Interlink** runs on the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) async runtime and structures portions of your
app using "Services" which can be communicated with using "Links" which allow sending messages to
Services that can then be handled

> ðŸš© This project is in its very early infantcy so breaking changes are
> expected and at this stage its not entirely feature complete or tested 

## Using Interlink

Adding the following cargo dependency to include interlink in your project

```toml
[dependencies]
interlink = "0.1" 
```

## Starting a service

In order to get a link to a service and for the service to run you will first need to start the service


```rust
use interlink::prelude::*;

/// Define your backing structure for the service you can use
/// the service derive macro here or implement the trait to
/// get access to the `started` and `stopping` hooks
#[derive(Service)]
struct Example;

// You must be within the tokio runtime to use interlink
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create the service
    let service = Example {};
    // Start the service to get a link to the service
    let link = service.start();
}

```

## Sending a message to a service

To communicate with services and between services you use messages below
is an example of how to create and send messages.

```rust
use interlink::prelude::*;

// Define your backing structure for the service
#[derive(Service)]
struct Example;

// The message struct with a string response type
#[derive(Message)]
#[msg(rtype = "String")]
struct TextMessage {
    value: String,
}

/// Implement a handler for the message type
impl Handler<TextMessage> for Example {

    /// Basic response type which just responds with the value
    type Response = Mr<TextMessage>

    fn handle(
        &mut self, 
        msg: TextMessage, 
        ctx: &mut ServiceContext<Self>
    ) -> Self::Response {
        println!("Got message: {}", &msg.value);
        Mr(msg.value)
    }
}

// You must be within the tokio runtime to use interlink
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create the service
    let service = Example {};
    // Start the service to get a link to the service
    let link = service.start();

    // Send the text message to the service and await the response
    let res: String = link.send(TextMessage {
            value: "Example".to_string(),
        })
        .await
        .unwrap();

    assert_eq!(&res, "Example");

    // You can also send without waiting for a response
    link.do_send(TextMessage {
            value: "Example".to_string(),
        })
        .unwrap();

}

```
